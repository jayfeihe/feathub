## Introduction

FeatHub is an open-source feature store designed to simplify the development and
deployment of machine learning models. It supports feature ETL and provides an
easy-to-use Python SDK that abstracts away the complexities of point-in-time
correctness needed to avoid training-serving skew. With FeatHub, data scientists
can speed up the feature deployment process and optimize feature ETL by
automatically compiling declarative feature definitions into performant
distributed ETL jobs using state-of-the-art computation engines of their choice,
such as Flink or Spark.

Checkout [Documentation](docs/content) for guidance on compute
engines, connectors, expression language, and more.


## Core Benefits

Similar to other feature stores, FeatHub provides the following core benefits:

- **Simplified feature development**: The Pythonic [FeatHub
SDK](docs/content/feathub-sdk) makes it easy to develop features without worrying
about point-in-time correctness.  This helps to avoid training-serving skew,
which can negatively impact the accuracy of machine learning models.
- **Faster feature deployment**: FeatHub automatically compiles user-specified
declarative feature definitions into performant distributed ETL jobs using
state-of-the-art computation engines, such as Flink or Spark. This speeds up
the feature deployment process and eliminates the need for data engineers to
re-write Python programs into distributed stream or batch processing jobs.
- **Performant feature generation**: FeatHub offers a range of [built-in
  optimizations](docs/content/deep-dive/optimizations.md) that leverage commonly
observed feature ETL job patterns. These optimizations are automatically applied
to ETL jobs compiled from the declarative feature definitions, much like how SQL
optimizations are applied.
- **Facilitated feature sharing**: FeatHub allows developers to register and
query feature definitions in a persistent [feature
registry](docs/content/registries). This capability reduces the duplication of
data engineering efforts and the resource cost of feature generation by
allowing developers in the organization to share and re-use existing feature
definitions and datasets.

In addition to the above benefits, FeatHub provides several architectural
benefits compared to other feature stores, including:

- **Real-time feature generation**: FeatHub supports real-time feature
generation using [Apache Flink](docs/content/engines/flink.md) as the stream
computation engine with milli-second latency. This provides better performance
than other open-source feature stores that only support feature generation
using Apache Spark.

- **Assisted feature monitoring**: FeatHub provides [built-in
metrics](docs/content/metric-stores) to monitor the quality of features and
alert users to issues such as feature drift. This helps to improve the accuracy
and reliability of machine learning models.

- **Stream-batch unified computation**: FeatHub allows for consistent feature
computation across offline, nearline, and online stacks using [Apache
Flink](docs/content/engines/flink.md) for real-time features with low latency,
[Apache Spark](docs/content/engines/spark.md) for offline features with high
throughput, and FeatureService for computing features online when the request
is received.

- **Extensible framework**: FeatHub's Python SDK is decoupled from the APIs of
the underlying computation engines, providing flexibility and avoiding lock-in.
This allows for the support of additional computation engines in the future.
For example, FeatHub supports [Local
Processor](docs/content/engines/local.md) that is implemented using Pandas
library, in addition to its support for Apache Flink and Apache Spark.

Usability is a crucial factor that sets feature store projects apart. Our SDK is
designed to be **Pythonic**, **declarative**, intuitive, and highly expressive to
support all the necessary feature transformations. We understand that a feature
store's success depends on its usability as it directly affects developers'
productivity. Check out the [FeatHub SDK Highlights](#feathub-sdk-highlights)
section below to learn more about the exceptional usability of our SDK.


<!-- TODO: provide examples showing the advantage of python SDK over SQL. -->

## What you can do with FeatHub

With FeatHub, you can:
- **Define new features**: Define features as the result of applying
expressions, aggregations, and cross-table joins on existing features, all with
point-in-time correctness.
- **Read and write features data**: Read and write feature data into a variety
  of offline, nearline, and online [storage
systems](docs/content/connectors) for both offline training and online
serving.
- **Backfill features data**: Process historical data with the given time range
and/or keys to backfill feature data, whic
- **Run experiments**: Run experiments on the local machine using
LocalProcessor without connecting to Apache Flink or Apache Spark cluster. Then
deploy the FeatHub program in a distributed Apache Flink or Apache Spark
cluster by changing the program configuration.

## FeatHub SDK Highlights

The following examples demonstrate how to define a variety of features
concisely using FeatHub SDK. See [FeatHub
SDK](docs/content/feathub-sdk) for more details.

See [NYC Taxi Demo](docs/examples/nyc_taxi.ipynb) to learn more about how to
define, generate and serve features using FeatHub SDK.

- Define features via table joins with point-in-time correctness

```python
f_price = Feature(
    name="price",
    transform=JoinTransform(
        table_name="price_update_events",
        feature_name="price"
    ),
    keys=["item_id"],
)
```

- Define over-window aggregation features:

```python
f_total_payment_last_two_minutes = Feature(
    name="total_payment_last_two_minutes",
    transform=OverWindowTransform(
        expr="item_count * price",
        agg_func="SUM",
        window_size=timedelta(minutes=2),
        group_by_keys=["user_id"]
    )
)
```

- Define sliding-window aggregation features:

```python
f_total_payment_last_two_minutes = Feature(
    name="total_payment_last_two_minutes",
    transform=SlidingWindowTransform(
        expr="item_count * price",
        agg_func="SUM",
        window_size=timedelta(minutes=2),
        step_size=timedelta(minutes=1),
        group_by_keys=["user_id"]
    )
)
```

- Define features via built-in functions and the FeatHub expression language:

```python
f_trip_time_duration = Feature(
    name="f_trip_time_duration",
    transform="UNIX_TIMESTAMP(taxi_dropoff_datetime) - UNIX_TIMESTAMP(taxi_pickup_datetime)",
)
```

- Define a feature via Python UDF:

```python
f_lower_case_name = Feature(
    name="lower_case_name",
    dtype=types.String,
    transform=PythonUdfTransform(lambda row: row["name"].lower()),
)
```
